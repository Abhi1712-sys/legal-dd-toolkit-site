    This toolkit is an independent legal project developed to understand and simulate
    real-world corporate due diligence and compliance processes.
  </p>

  <p>
    It bridges the gap between academic legal study and corporate legal practice by
    providing structured, document-driven workflows used in transactions, investments,
    and internal compliance reviews.
